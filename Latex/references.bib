The rhythmicon was one of the first electronic instruments to use technology to extend performers' musical capacities, anticipating the interactive computer music movement by several decades.},

Alongside a capsule history of the drum machine and its impact upon popular music, Wang cites seminal uses of electronic rhythms by Sly Stone and Phil Collins, producers of disco and early hip hop; and game-changing machines such as the Maestro Rhythm King, Wurlitzer Side Man, Roland CR-78, Linn LM-1, Oberheim DMX, and Roland TR-808/TR-909.},
