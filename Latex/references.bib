	abstract = {In the early 1930s, Cowell collaborated with Lev Sergeevič Termen (Léon Thérémin) to build an electronic instrument capable of producing intricate polyrhythms, the rhythmicon, which may be considered a rudimentary example of an integrated music system. The rhythmicon was one of the first electronic instruments to use technology to extend performers' musical capacities, anticipating the interactive computer music movement by several decades.},

A classic coffee table book that focuses on visual aesthetics over sonic utility or sociological insight, it is still deemed groundbreaking as the first book dedicated to the device. Alongside a capsule history of the drum machine and its impact upon popular music, Wang cites seminal uses of electronic rhythms by Sly Stone and Phil Collins, producers of disco and early hip hop; and game-changing machines such as the Maestro Rhythm King, Wurlitzer Side Man, Roland CR-78, Linn LM-1, Oberheim DMX, and Roland TR-808/TR-909.},
